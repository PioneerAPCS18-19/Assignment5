# Assignment 5

You will be using methods and fields from the `Math` class in order to generate points from a trigonometric function. Please refer to your notes and the offical [Java docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html).

## Specifications

1. Take input from the user for the angle in degrees. 
2. Convert from degrees to radians.
3. Evaluate for the function value.
4. Print the point.

### Sample Outputs

```
Enter an x value (degrees): 0
The point is: (0.0, -1.1213203435596428)
```

```
Enter an x value (degrees): 120
The point is: (2.0943951023931953, 0.22354286469243734)
```

```
Enter an x value (degrees): -315
The point is: (-5.497787143782138, -2.0)
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style (variable naming, spacing, indentation, etc.).
